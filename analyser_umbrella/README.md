# AnalyserUmbrella

This is a proof of concept project showcasing processing of Telemetry events.
It's an umbrella project containing the emitter of Telemetry events as well as 
an analyser.
The first one is written in Erlang and the latter in Elixir to explore the
interoperability of the BEAM based languages.
